# One can write arbitrary comments in this file after hashes,
# but keep in mind that students will be able to see such comments.

# The first non-comment line of the file is the title of the

Homework 2

# Next, typing conventions are entered. If no typing conventions
# are given, some defaults are used.

constants of type e : c p r s j m
variables of type e : x-z
variables of type v : e
variables of type <e,t> : P-Q X-Z
variables of type <e,et> : R
variables of type <e,<e,et>> : S
variables of type <v,t> : T

# The following directive instructs the program to
# interpret multiple-letter constants and variables
# properly.

multiple letter identifiers

# "use rule" directives are for tree evaluation exercises.
# They indicate which composition rules are available
# at nonterminals.

use rule function application
use rule non-branching nodes
use rule predicate modification
use rule lambda abstraction

# Next, lexical entries provided to the student are given.
# A word (i.e. "sleep") can be given any number of lexical
# entry choices by repeating the "define" directive multiple
# times. Students are able to add their own lexical entries
# as well.

define sleep,sleeps : Lx[sleep(x)]
define happy : Lx[happy(x)]
define guy : Lx[guy(x)]
define love, loves : LyLx[love(x,y)]
define someone, somebody : LX[Ex[X(x)]]
define everyone, everybody : LX[Ax[X(x)]]
# TODO when we define "someone" as  LP[Ex[P(x)]],
# we should get an immediate warning because P is declared above to 
# be a constant
define a : LX.LY.[Ex[X(x)&Y(x)]]
define is : LX.Lx.[X(x)]

# can we define "is" as LX.X?
define John : j	
define Mary : m

title Formulating NatLg denotations as lambda-expressions
directions In some languages, there is a morpheme (e.g., Middle Voice in Ancient 
directions Greek, reflexivizing affix in Kannada, Passive Voice in Finnish, etc.) 
directions that attaches to the verb stem and reduces its arity by one. Let us 
directions take the following imaginary morphemes α, β, γ, and δ. 
directions Assuming the syntactic structure given, give a denotation for each of 
directions these morphemes (in lambda-notation, for any arbitrary situation). \\
directions \\
directions Note the typing conventions of P, R and S.

title More NatLg denotations as lambda-expressions.
directions We have assumed that, in the formal translation of a sentence,
directions a predicate combines with its Agent, Patient, Goal, etc., directly,
directions as shown in (2)-(3) (as in PrL): \\
directions  \\
directions (1)	Ron hugged Sue. \\
directions (2)	[[(1)]] = 1 iff {HUG(r,s)} \\
directions (3)	[[hug]] = {LxLy.HUG(y,x)} \\
directions \\
directions An alternative view posits that the formal predicate combines only to
directions its event argument, while the theta roles are introduced as separate
directions formal predicates relating the event to the relevant argument. This
directions approach, called neo-Davidsonian, is exemplified in (4), where e is
directions an event variable, type v.  To achieve the truth conditions in (4),
directions two compositional approaches have been pursued: (5) and (6). \\
directions (4)	[[(1)]] = 1 iff {Ee_v.[HUGG\ING(e) & \AG(e,r) & P\AT(e,s)]} \\
directions (5)	[[hug]] = {LxLyLe_v.HUGG\ING(e) & \AG(e,y) & P\AT(e,x)}  \\
directions (6)	[[hug]]	= {Le_v.HUGG\ING(e)} \\
directions In this exercise we’ll concentrate in the second version of the
directions neo-Davidsonian approach, in (6).
