2018-09-02: Version 2.2.0
-------------------------

fix loading of student exercises saved with traces
add support applying functions with product types
add support for nested product types
open window goes to Downloads directory at beginning of session
open window goes to previous open directory otherwise
updated "About" window in Mac


2015-12-07: Version 2.1.0
-------------------------

* replace [[ ]] with << >>
* choose variables based on indices, eliminating need for (explicitly
represented) assignment fns
* functions wrapped in [ ] instead of ( )
* bracketing conventions now match Heim and Kratzer
* add support for *-ed constants
* add individual-level fusion, via +, and part-of, via <:
(with Ctrl-: as interactive keyboard shortcut)
* single-letter identifiers off by default (since bound variables are now
hardcoded to have multiple characters, e.g. v2)
* eliminate precedence conventions between and/or and if/iff
* infix grouping with [ ] instead of ( )
* apostrophe rather than ? indicates type var (e.g., <'at,t> rather than
<?at,t>)

* treat cat nodes above dummy terms as dummies (fixes bug)
* reduce terms in all positions of an arglist (fixes bugs)
* match type vars with functional types to support, e.g.,
generalized junction (fixes bugs)
* display previous lambda conversion exercises when focused


2013-04-01: Version 2.0.0-beta
------------------------------

Codesigned Mac application to bypass Gatekeeper security checks
Support for Intensional Function Application
Traces and indices with arbitrary type specifications
Export trees to LaTeX
Support for polymorphic types on functions and arguments


2008-03-29: Version 1.0.12
--------------------------

Fixed alphabetical variants of { x | ... } notation.
Fixed loading saved exercise files that use the new expression types.

2008-03-21: Version 1.0.11
--------------------------

Treat { x | ... } as a binder.
In the scratch pad window, when there's a syntax error in the problem
statement, move the cursor to the location of the problem.
Allow the empty set symbol and raw integer numbers to be used in
predicate logic expressions.

2008-03-20: Version 1.0.10
--------------------------

Added to our predicate logic:
	Set notations { a, b, c } and { ... | ... }.
	Set intersection, union, subset, proper subset, superset, proper
	superset, and cardinality.
	Integer multiplication. This is for the 'most' generalized quantifier.
	Integer greater than, less than, those + or equal.
Added a new example file and updated the documentation for generalized
quantifiers.

Version 1.0.09
--------------------------

Allow omega and sigma symbols to be included in logical expressions.
Improved the naming conventions display for multiple letter identifiers.
In exercise files, parse multiple letter type conventions.
Update docs and example file.

2008-01-30: Version 1.0.08
--------------------------

Corrected a problem reading exercise files saved in UTF8 with an initial
byte order marker.
Corrected a problem saving exercise files with meaning brackets.

2007-12-12: Version 1.0.07
--------------------------

Corrected a problem saving exercise files with identifier conventions
without explicit description text.
Fix typo-type mistakes in example2.txt
