          <i>The Lambda Calculator</i> is an interactive, graphical application
          to help students of natural language semantics practice derivations
          in the typed lambda calculus. It is designed for both students and
          teachers, with modules for online classroom instruction, graded
          homework assignments, and self-guided practice. The primary function
          is to assist in the computation of natural language denotations up a
          syntactic tree in the style of Heim &amp; Kratzer (1998). To this
          end, the program detects common errors and attempts to provide
          intelligent feedback to the student user and a record of performance
          for the instructor.

          <a href="http://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/002118"> the interaction of
          compositional semantics and event semantics</a> gives an impression

          <p>
            [The Calculator] covers most of the common ground of formal
            semantics and it is great fun using it, and the notation is
            compatible with many introductions to semantics, e.g. the book of
            Heim and Kratzer. Students working with that tool will love it and
            possibly fall in love with formal semantics of natural language. I
            always wanted to have such a tool for my teaching.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I learned about the program toward the middle of the semester, but
            once I knew about and briefly tested it, I did not hesitate to
            introduce it to the class. [...] Had I known about the program
            before I prepared my syllabus for the class, I definitely would
            have designed my class so that we can make use of the program more
            extensively. I would recommend PLC to anyone who is willing to
            explore some better ways to teach and learn the sometimes tedious
            and confusing work of lambda derivations.

          <p>
            I wished it had already existed at the moment when I made my first
            steps in formal semantics; certainly, I would have learned faster
            and easier. One can only master the lambda calculus (and formal
            linguistics in general) by getting one's hands dirty, that is, by
            experimenting and testing. The calculator provides students with
            hints and immediate feedback whether their proposed solution is
            correct or not.

          <p>
            I am very grateful for your having the Penn Lambda Calculator so
            generously available to teachers and students of Formal Semantics.
            As an instructor of a graduate-level course using Heim &amp;
            Kratzer (1998), I can attest how invaluable this resource has been
            for both me and my students as well. The lambda notation is not
            easy for students who, despite their linguistics training, are not
            familiar with the formal apparatus of set theory, propositional
            calculus and predicate logic. As I teach to Spanish-speaking
            students, it adds to the inherent difficulty of the subject the
            fact that the textbooks and the exercises included are mostly in
            English. With the lambda calculator I can create exercises using
            lexicon (and instructions) in Spanish that allow my students to
            practice how to simplify lambda expressions and calculate the
            denotations of syntactic trees at home. In the classroom it makes
            it possible to discuss problems that will take forever otherwise.

        <blockquote>
          <p> I found the Calculator especially helpful for the individual
          training of students during recitations. It allowed each of them to
          follow their own pace. Students were all very positive about using
          it mostly because it is an interactive tool and provides intelligent
          feedback. The course is based on the Heim and Kratzer 1998 textbook
          <i>Semantics in Generative Grammar </i>which makes the tool a very
          valuable asset not only because it is designed to accompany that
          textbook but also because the textbook itself puts an accent on
          practice and exercise for mastering the calculating techniques and
          internalizing the principles behind them. In short, this is an
          excellent pedagogical tool which I will continue using in my future
          work.  </p>

          <p> The software is groundbreaking and ingenious &mdash; no one has
          written anything like it before and it is well-designed to fit into
          a formal semantics course. I especially like the guidance it gives
          students when they make mistakes &mdash; that was a very clever
          feature.</p>

          For Windows: download the file and unzip. Enter the resulting folder called LCSE. It contains
          an .exe file and a subfolder called jre180 which contains a Java runtime environment. 
          Double-click on the .exe file to start. As long as the 
          .exe file and jre180 are kept in the same folder, the application 
          will run out of the box with no need to install Java separately. Unless you have a separate Java runtime environment 
          installed on your computer, do not move the exe file out of the LCSE folder, and do not move 
          or delete the jre180 folder. 
        </p>

          For Linux: make sure you have either <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/">Oracle's java</a> or 
          <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/">openjdk</a> installed, in each case version 1.8 
          or higher. (Avoid GNU libgcj as this will not work.) You can check which version of java you have with
          <code>java -version</code>. To launch the application, type <code>java
          -jar Lambda_Calculator_SE_Unix_2.5.0.jar</code>.

        <h5>Teacher Edition</h5>
        <p>
          The teacher edition, in which tree-derivation exercises can be shown
          in a presentation mode that automatically computes denotations of
          nonterminals, is available upon request to instructors. Please send an
          email to:

        <p>
          If you are an instructor, email us, and we will be happy to send you
          more exercise files. And if you write exercise files yourself,
          please consider sending them to us so we can share them with other
          instructors.

          The calculator is under active development, and may exhibit
          unexpected behavior from time to time, especially if you're using
          one of the Beta releases. If you encounter something strange, or
          would like to see some additional functionality, we're all ears. Our
          bug reports and feature requests are managed through on our
          <a href="https://github.com/nyusemantics/LambdaCalculatorPublic/issues">Github
            Issues</a> page. Please take a look at the open issues to see if
          your problem has already been reported (and if so, to check the
          progress on fixing it). You can report new issues or make new
          requests directly through the Issues page, if you have a registered
          Github account. Otherwise, just shoot us an email (<img
          src="images/email.png" alt="" style="inline; vertical-align:middle;"/>),
          and we'll create a ticket that you can monitor for updates. In
          either case, include any information you can that will help us
          reproduce the problem, including exercise files, screenshots, and
          information about your operating system and the version of the
          calculator that you're using.
